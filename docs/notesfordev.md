Jellyfin AI Media Stack Integration with PMOVES and Cataclysm
It's an excellent goal to integrate the Jellyfin AI Media Stack with your broader PMOVES system and make it deployable with the Cataclysm Provisioning Bundle. This creates a powerful synergy between media intelligence, autonomous agent orchestration, and efficient infrastructure deployment.
Integrating the Jellyfin AI Media Stack with PMOVES
The Jellyfin AI Media Stack, which leverages Google LangExtract powered by Gemini for entity extraction [1], is designed to be a crucial "specialized AI muscle" within the PMOVES architecture [2]. Its robust features for audio/video analysis and content creation directly enhance PMOVES' capabilities for research, data processing, and content generation.
Here's how the Jellyfin AI Media Stack integrates with PMOVES:
1. Unified Data Backend with Supabase:
    â—¦ The Jellyfin AI Media Stack uses Supabase as its backend database for user data and media metadata [3, 4].
    â—¦ Crucially, Supabase is also the unified database with vector capabilities for the entire PMOVES system [2, 5]. This means that all media-related metadata, AI analysis results, and extracted entities from the Jellyfin stack can be seamlessly stored and integrated into the central PMOVES knowledge base, making them accessible for broader reasoning and retrieval.
2. Shared Structured Information Extraction with LangExtract (Gemini-powered):
    â—¦ The Jellyfin AI Media Stack explicitly employs Google LangExtract for structured information extraction from media content, creating data for Neo4j knowledge graphs and enabling RAG strategies [1]. It uses Gemini-powered entity extraction [1].
    â—¦ LangExtract is a core component ("specialized AI muscle") within PMOVES itself, designed to extract structured information from unstructured text documents with precise source grounding [2, 6]. This ensures that insights derived from your media (e.g., key topics, people, concepts from transcripts) directly enrich PMOVES' knowledge, improving traceability and reducing hallucinations [1, 6]. LangExtract can process documents directly from URLs and supports parallel processing [7].
3. Enhanced Knowledge Management with Archon and HiRAG:
    â—¦ The rich metadata and structured data generated by the Jellyfin stack's AI models (e.g., transcriptions from Whisper [8], object detections from YOLO v11 [9], and entities from LangExtract [1]) can be ingested into Archon's robust knowledge management system [6, 7].
    â—¦ Archon offers smart web crawling, document processing, code example extraction, and vector search with advanced RAG strategies [6, 7]. This allows PMOVES agents to query and retrieve deep insights from the analyzed media.
    â—¦ Furthermore, this enriched, multi-layered knowledge can be processed by HiRAG (Hierarchical Retrieval-Augmented Generation) within PMOVES to enable deeper, fact-based reasoning on complex knowledge structures, overcoming limitations of traditional RAG [2, 6]. HiRAG builds hierarchical indices and retrieves information based on entities, communities, and global bridges [7].
4. Orchestration and Task Delegation with Agent Zero and n8n:
    â—¦ The Jellyfin AI Media Stack includes an Orchestrator microservice and an API Gateway for workflow coordination and external integrations [3, 4].
    â—¦ Agent Zero, as the primary orchestrator of the PMOVES system, can delegate tasks to the Jellyfin media stack [7, 10]. For example, Agent Zero can use its online search capabilities to find relevant YouTube content and then delegate the download and analysis to the Jellyfin stack's YouTube Downloader component via an n8n workflow [3, 10, 11].
    â—¦ n8n serves as the automation and workflow orchestration layer and the MCP Hub within PMOVES, facilitating seamless communication and task hand-offs between Agent Zero and the Jellyfin AI Media Stack's services [7, 10].
5. Content Creation Synergy with ComfyUI:
    â—¦ The Jellyfin AI Media Stack provides capabilities for YouTube Content Creation Workflows, including extracting key moments, generating talking points, and identifying topics for tags via entity extraction [12, 13].
    â—¦ These analytical outputs are highly valuable inputs for ComfyUI, which PMOVES integrates for sophisticated content creation workflows, automated via n8n [2, 5]. This allows PMOVES to generate new media, reports, or visualizations based on the rich insights from the Jellyfin stack.
6. Distributed Model Execution:
    â—¦ Both the Jellyfin AI Media Stack and PMOVES are designed to leverage local AI models and distributed computing [2, 5]. The Jellyfin stack's AI services (Audio AI Service, Video AI Service, Entity Extraction) [3] can run on the same distributed hardware network (e.g., Primary Workstation, Edge Computing Jetson Orin Nano Super devices) that PMOVES uses for its local models like Ollama and NVIDIA NIM [2, 14, 15]. This maximizes efficiency and keeps data local.
7. Docker-based Architecture:
    â—¦ The Jellyfin AI Media Stack is a Docker-based solution with an enhanced Docker architecture [3, 4]. This aligns perfectly with PMOVES' reliance on Docker for isolating and deploying components across its distributed infrastructure [14, 16].
Deploying the Jellyfin AI Media Stack with the Cataclysm Provisioning Bundle
The Cataclysm Provisioning Bundle is specifically designed for the mass deployment of Docker Compose stacks on various workstations and edge devices [17, 18]. This makes it an ideal tool for deploying your Jellyfin AI Media Stack across your PMOVES distributed hardware.
Hereâ€™s how you can achieve this:
â€¢ Docker Compose Integration: The Jellyfin AI Media Stack is already structured as a multi-service Docker application, as indicated by the presence of docker-compose.yml in your Pmoves-Jelly repository [3, 4, 19]. The Cataclysm bundle supports deploying "Ready-to-run Docker Compose stacks" [17]. You would integrate the Jellyfin stack's docker-compose.yml and associated configuration files into the Cataclysm bundle.
â€¢ Automated Deployment Scripts:
    â—¦ Ubuntu Autoinstall (Servers/VMs): For Linux-based hosts like your workstations, the Cataclysm bundle uses linux/ubuntu-autoinstall/user-data for unattended Ubuntu installs, which also sets up Docker [18]. This script can be extended to include commands to clone the Pmoves-Jelly repository (or a subset of it), navigate to the Jellyfin AI Media Stack directory, and execute docker compose up -d to bring up the entire stack automatically.
    â—¦ Jetson Orin Nano Bootstrap (Edge Devices): For your Edge Computing Jetson Orin Nano Super devices, the Cataclysm bundle uses jetson/jetson-postinstall.sh to bootstrap Docker and NVIDIA runtime [17]. Given that the Jellyfin stack's AI models (e.g., NVIDIA Sortformer [20]) benefit from GPU acceleration [11], deploying the Audio AI Service and Video AI Service microservices specifically to these Jetson devices would be highly efficient. A dedicated Docker Compose file or modifications to the jetson-postinstall.sh could selectively deploy these services, integrating them into the larger PMOVES edge computing strategy [15].
â€¢ Configuration and Secrets Management:
    â—¦ The Jellyfin AI Media Stack relies on environment variables (.env file) for configuration, including Supabase credentials, Neo4j password, and API keys [21].
    â—¦ The Cataclysm bundle manages secrets through placeholders and scripts [22]. You can create a template .env file within the provisioning bundle with placeholders (e.g., SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL_HERE) that your Cataclysm post-install scripts can populate with actual secrets, potentially sourced from a secure vault or encrypted configuration.
    â—¦ The Supabase setup script required by the Jellyfin stack [21] could also be included in the Cataclysm provisioning process, perhaps by executing it via the Supabase CLI as part of an initial setup script on the host where the database is configured.
By combining the AI capabilities of the Jellyfin stack with the autonomous orchestration of PMOVES and the efficient deployment of Cataclysm, you can create a highly sophisticated, self-managing media intelligence and content creation system.

: Google Gemini CLI Integration with Agent Zero & Archon in Jules Environments
Google Gemini CLI Integration with Agent Zero & Archon in Jules Environments
This document provides guidance on how Google's Gemini Command Line Interface (CLI) is integrated and leveraged within the autonomous multi-agent system, orchestrated by Agent Zero, managed by Archon, and executed within Jules environments.
1. Introduction
The Google Gemini CLI serves as a powerful tool within our multi-agent ecosystem, allowing Agent Zero and its specialized subordinate agents to access Google's advanced Gemini AI models for a wide range of tasks. By integrating Gemini CLI into Jules' secure virtual machines, agents can perform sophisticated AI operations reliably and contextually, guided by Archon's knowledge base and orchestrated by n8n.
2. Key Capabilities Enabled by Gemini CLI Integration
â€¢ AI-Powered Code Generation and Refinement: Agents can use Gemini CLI to generate code snippets, entire functions, or debug existing code within a live development environment provided by Jules.
â€¢ Intelligent Data Analysis and Summarization: Gemini CLI assists agents in processing large datasets, extracting insights, and generating concise summaries or reports.
â€¢ Advanced Research and Content Creation: Agents can utilize Gemini to assist in synthesizing research findings, drafting technical content, or exploring complex topics.
â€¢ Natural Language Interaction: Agents can formulate prompts for Gemini CLI using natural language, allowing for flexible and intuitive AI interactions.
3. How Agents Utilize Gemini CLI (Workflow)
The process typically follows these steps, orchestrated by Agent Zero:
1. Task Delegation by Agent Zero: The primary Agent Zero, as the core decision-maker, identifies a task that requires the advanced AI capabilities of Google Gemini [1.1, 1.3]. It then delegates this task to a subordinate agent it creates [1.3, 1.14].
2. Jules Environment Provisioning: The subordinate agent, or Agent Zero itself, requests a secure, short-lived virtual machine (VM) from Jules [3.3].
    â—¦ Environment Setup: Jules will either study the repository for environment setup to install necessary dependencies or the agent can provide a setup script to explicitly install Google Gemini CLI and any other required tools (e.g., Python packages for data processing) [3.3, 3.4, 3.5].
3. Execution in Jules: Once the Jules VM is ready, the agent can write its own code and use the terminal to execute Google Gemini CLI commands [1.14, 3.4]. This ensures that Gemini operations are performed in an isolated and controlled environment.
4. Knowledge Context from Archon: During the task, the agent can access Archon's knowledge and task management backbone for AI coding assistants [1.5]. This includes:
    â—¦ Smart web crawling of Gemini documentation sites [1.7, 1.40].
    â—¦ Code example extraction for optimal Gemini CLI usage [1.7, 1.40].
    â—¦ Vector search for advanced semantic retrieval of Gemini-related context [1.7, 1.40].
    â—¦ Advanced RAG strategies (hybrid search, contextual embeddings, reranking) for optimal AI responses and better-informed Gemini prompts [1.8, 1.41].
    â—¦ The agent accesses Archon as an MCP server [1.5, 1.43].
5. Output Processing: The output from the Gemini CLI command is captured by the agent. This output can then be further processed, for instance, by LangExtract to extract structured information from unstructured text responses [1.17, 1.60].
6. Reporting and Learning: The processed results are reported back to the primary Agent Zero. Crucially, Agent Zero's persistent memory allows it to memorize previous solutions, code, facts, and instructions related to effective Gemini CLI usage to solve future tasks faster and more reliably [1.3, 1.14].
7. n8n Workflow Orchestration: n8n acts as the "MCP Hub" and automation layer, facilitating seamless communication and task delegation between Agent Zero, Jules, and Archon throughout this workflow [1.1, 1.10, 1.11, 1.59].
4. Configuration
â€¢ Jules Setup Scripts: For complex environments or specific Gemini CLI versions, agents can define setup scripts within their repositories or as part of the task definition that Jules will execute [3.4, 3.5].
â€¢ API Keys: Ensure the necessary Google Gemini API keys are configured for the agent running within the Jules VM, typically passed as environment variables.
â€¢ Archon Context Engineering: Maintain Gemini CLI documentation and usage guides within Archon's knowledge base for easy retrieval by agents [1.6, 1.40].
5. Self-Improvement and Gemini CLI
The system is designed for autonomous upgrading and self-improvement [1.15, 1.63]. This applies directly to Gemini CLI usage:
â€¢ Researching New Gemini Features: Agents can use Agent Zero's online search capabilities to actively search platforms like GitHub for new Gemini CLI features, libraries, or integration examples [1.3, 1.15]. Archon's smart web crawling can ingest documentation from these sources [1.7, 1.40].
â€¢ Learning Optimal Prompting: Agents can analyze best practices and feedback on Gemini CLI interactions. LangExtract can process textual data from research papers or blogs to structure insights on effective Gemini prompting [1.17, 1.60, 1.70].
â€¢ Implementing Advanced RAG: The system can evaluate and integrate new Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques like HiRAG to improve how agents retrieve and contextualize information before generating prompts for Gemini or processing its output [1.17, 1.21, 1.60]. HiRAG provides deeper reasoning on complex, multi-layered knowledge structures [1.21].
â€¢ Self-Learning AI Agent Reasoning (UR2 Principles): The system aims for agents to learn generalizable dynamic policies for knowledge acquisition, including when to rely on internal knowledge vs. seeking external information for Gemini CLI tasks [1.15, 1.59].
6. Example Usage Scenario
Task: "Generate a Python script to analyze a CSV file, extract key entities, and summarize the findings, explaining each step."
1. Agent Zero receives the task and identifies that Gemini's capabilities are required for analysis and summarization.
2. A subordinate agent is created. It requests a Jules VM configured with Python and Google Gemini CLI (via a setup script).
3. The agent accesses Archon's knowledge base for best practices on CSV analysis with Gemini and Python, retrieving relevant code examples and data parsing techniques.
4. The agent uses the Gemini CLI within the Jules terminal to first process the CSV file, generate a Python script for entity extraction, and then summarize the extracted information.
5. LangExtract processes Gemini's textual output to structure the key entities and summarized findings.
6. The agent then constructs a final report and provides it to Agent Zero, along with the generated Python script and explanation.
7. Agent Zero's persistent memory stores this successful workflow, including the specific Gemini CLI commands and Archon knowledge used, for future similar tasks.
sorry i actually want to integrate crush cli  and also the kellyfin ai media stack . i am working on a work https://github.com/POWERFULMOVES/Pmoves-Jelly and i want to integrate it with POWERFULMOVES

It's great to hear you're looking to integrate Crush CLI and the Jellyfin AI Media Stack into your POWERFULMOVES/Pmoves-Jelly project and the broader PMOVES system. Let's explore how these components fit together based on the provided sources.
Integrating the Jellyfin AI Media Stack with PMOVES
The Jellyfin AI Media Stack is a well-defined component within your POWERFULMOVES/Pmoves-Jelly repository, and its integration with the overarching PMOVES system is already strongly supported by the architecture described in the sources.
Key Components and Features of the Jellyfin AI Media Stack: The "AI-Enhanced Media Stack" is designed for comprehensive audio/video analysis, YouTube content downloading with yt-dlp, FFmpeg video processing, and Google LangExtract for entity extraction and RAG strategies. It includes:
â€¢ AI Models Suite for audio analysis (e.g., Whisper Large v3 Turbo, WhisperX for diarization, Pyannote Audio, NVIDIA Sortformer, SeaLLMs-Audio-7B, Emotion Recognition Models) and video analysis (e.g., YOLO v11 for object detection, Vision Transformers, CLIP for vision-language understanding, Flamingo for video-language reasoning).
â€¢ Google LangExtract, powered by Gemini, specifically for structured information extraction, creating data for Neo4j knowledge graphs, and enabling semantic search and content relationships.
â€¢ An enhanced Docker architecture with specialized microservices, including Jellyfin, Neo4j, Supabase, Redis, Audio AI Service, Video AI Service, YouTube Downloader, Entity Extraction, and an Orchestrator.
â€¢ A workflow covering Content Ingestion (YouTube download, local files, Jellyfin integration), Audio Analysis Pipeline, Video Analysis Pipeline, and Entity Extraction & RAG Strategy.
â€¢ Supabase as the backend database for user data and media metadata, and Neo4j as a graph database for content relationships and recommendations.
â€¢ An API Gateway for external integrations.
â€¢ Capabilities for YouTube Content Creation Workflow, including content analysis for video creation (extracting key moments, generating talking points, identifying topics for tags via entity extraction), automated workflows, and SEO optimization (tag generation, description creation, thumbnail analysis).
How Jellyfin AI Media Stack Integrates with PMOVES:
The integration of the Jellyfin AI Media Stack is highly synergistic with the PMOVES system, leveraging shared components and architectural principles:
â€¢ Shared Database (Supabase): The Jellyfin AI Media Stack utilizes Supabase as its backend database for media metadata. Supabase is also the unified database with vector capabilities for the entire PMOVES system, storing vector embeddings generated by Archon and HiRAG. This common database provides a seamless way to share media-related metadata and AI analysis results across the ecosystem.
â€¢ LangExtract Integration: The Jellyfin stack explicitly uses Google LangExtract for entity extraction and RAG strategies. LangExtract is a core "specialized AI muscle" in the PMOVES architecture, used to extract structured information from unstructured text with precise source grounding. This means the structured knowledge derived from your media content can directly enrich the PMOVES knowledge base, making it accessible for broader reasoning and task execution.
â€¢ Workflow Orchestration with n8n: The Jellyfin stack features an Orchestrator microservice and an API Gateway. n8n, the automation and workflow orchestration layer in PMOVES, can connect to this API. This would allow the primary Agent Zero to delegate tasks such as initiating media analysis, triggering YouTube content downloads, or querying media insights through n8n workflows. The "YouTube Downloader" component of the Jellyfin stack can be directly invoked via n8n workflows, potentially driven by Agent Zero's online search capabilities.
â€¢ Knowledge Management with Archon and HiRAG: The rich metadata and structured data generated by the Jellyfin stack's AI models (e.g., from Whisper, YOLO, ViT, CLIP) can be ingested into Archon's robust knowledge management system. Archon offers smart web crawling, document processing, and code example extraction with vector search and advanced RAG strategies. This integration enhances Archon's knowledge base with deep media insights. Furthermore, this enriched knowledge can be processed by HiRAG (Hierarchical Retrieval-Augmented Generation) within PMOVES to enable deeper, fact-based reasoning on complex, multi-layered knowledge structures, overcoming limitations of traditional RAG.
â€¢ Content Creation with ComfyUI: The Jellyfin AI Media Stack supports YouTube Content Creation Workflows. This aligns perfectly with PMOVES' integration of ComfyUI for content creation workflows, automated via n8n. Insights from the media stack's audio/video analysis (e.g., key moments, emotional peaks, generated descriptions, tags) can feed into ComfyUI to produce sophisticated reports, visualizations, or new media content, as orchestrated by Agent Zero and n8n.
â€¢ Autonomous Learning and Self-Improvement: The data and insights from the Jellyfin AI Media Stack contribute to the persistent memory and self-learning AI agent reasoning (UR2) principles of Agent Zero. This allows the system to learn from media analysis, optimize content creation strategies, and potentially identify new research areas related to media processing or RAG techniques for its autonomous upgrading goals.
Integrating Crush CLI with PMOVES
Your POWERFULMOVES/Pmoves-Jelly GitHub repository includes a file named charmbracelet-crush.txt, indicating your intention to integrate Crush CLI.
However, the provided sources do not contain specific information about the functionality or purpose of "Crush CLI" or how it is intended to be used or integrated. The crush/README.md excerpt primarily shows standard GitHub navigation elements and does not describe what Crush is or what it does beyond being a GitHub repository from charmbracelet.
Therefore, based solely on the provided source material, I cannot offer details on how to integrate Crush CLI with the PMOVES system, as its capabilities are not described. You would need external documentation or information about Crush CLI to determine its role and potential integration points within your multi-agent architecture.
lets focus on the jellyfin ai stack a new prd and gemini.md goal is to have that service integrated with PMOVES and deployable with the  provisioning bundle  see README

It's an excellent goal to integrate the Jellyfin AI Media Stack with your broader PMOVES system and make it deployable with the Cataclysm Provisioning Bundle. This creates a powerful synergy between media intelligence, autonomous agent orchestration, and efficient infrastructure deployment.
Integrating the Jellyfin AI Media Stack with PMOVES
The Jellyfin AI Media Stack, which leverages Google LangExtract powered by Gemini for entity extraction, is designed to be a crucial "specialized AI muscle" within the PMOVES architecture. Its robust features for audio/video analysis and content creation directly enhance PMOVES' capabilities for research, data processing, and content generation.
Here's how the Jellyfin AI Media Stack integrates with PMOVES:
1. Unified Data Backend with Supabase:
    â—¦ The Jellyfin AI Media Stack uses Supabase as its backend database for user data and media metadata.
    â—¦ Crucially, Supabase is also the unified database with vector capabilities for the entire PMOVES system. This means that all media-related metadata, AI analysis results, and extracted entities from the Jellyfin stack can be seamlessly stored and integrated into the central PMOVES knowledge base, making them accessible for broader reasoning and retrieval.
2. Shared Structured Information Extraction with LangExtract (Gemini-powered):
    â—¦ The Jellyfin AI Media Stack explicitly employs Google LangExtract for structured information extraction from media content, creating data for Neo4j knowledge graphs and enabling RAG strategies. It uses Gemini-powered entity extraction.
    â—¦ LangExtract is a core component ("specialized AI muscle") within PMOVES itself, designed to extract structured information from unstructured text documents with precise source grounding. This ensures that insights derived from your media (e.g., key topics, people, concepts from transcripts) directly enrich PMOVES' knowledge, improving traceability and reducing hallucinations. LangExtract can process documents directly from URLs and supports parallel processing.
3. Enhanced Knowledge Management with Archon and HiRAG:
    â—¦ The rich metadata and structured data generated by the Jellyfin stack's AI models (e.g., transcriptions from Whisper, object detections from YOLO v11, and entities from LangExtract) can be ingested into Archon's robust knowledge management system.
    â—¦ Archon offers smart web crawling, document processing, code example extraction, and vector search with advanced RAG strategies. This allows PMOVES agents to query and retrieve deep insights from the analyzed media.
    â—¦ Furthermore, this enriched, multi-layered knowledge can be processed by HiRAG (Hierarchical Retrieval-Augmented Generation) within PMOVES to enable deeper, fact-based reasoning on complex knowledge structures, overcoming limitations of traditional RAG. HiRAG builds hierarchical indices and retrieves information based on entities, communities, and global bridges.
4. Orchestration and Task Delegation with Agent Zero and n8n:
    â—¦ The Jellyfin AI Media Stack includes an Orchestrator microservice and an API Gateway for workflow coordination and external integrations.
    â—¦ Agent Zero, as the primary orchestrator of the PMOVES system, can delegate tasks to the Jellyfin media stack. For example, Agent Zero can use its online search capabilities to find relevant YouTube content and then delegate the download and analysis to the Jellyfin stack's YouTube Downloader component via an n8n workflow.
    â—¦ n8n serves as the automation and workflow orchestration layer and the MCP Hub within PMOVES, facilitating seamless communication and task hand-offs between Agent Zero and the Jellyfin AI Media Stack's services.
5. Content Creation Synergy with ComfyUI:
    â—¦ The Jellyfin AI Media Stack provides capabilities for YouTube Content Creation Workflows, including extracting key moments, generating talking points, and identifying topics for tags via entity extraction.
    â—¦ These analytical outputs are highly valuable inputs for ComfyUI, which PMOVES integrates for sophisticated content creation workflows, automated via n8n. This allows PMOVES to generate new media, reports, or visualizations based on the rich insights from the Jellyfin stack.
6. Distributed Model Execution:
    â—¦ Both the Jellyfin AI Media Stack and PMOVES are designed to leverage local AI models and distributed computing. The Jellyfin stack's AI services (Audio AI Service, Video AI Service, Entity Extraction) can run on the same distributed hardware network (e.g., Primary Workstation, Edge Computing Jetson Orin Nano Super devices) that PMOVES uses for its local models like Ollama and NVIDIA NIM. This maximizes efficiency and keeps data local.
7. Docker-based Architecture:
    â—¦ The Jellyfin AI Media Stack is a Docker-based solution with an enhanced Docker architecture. This aligns perfectly with PMOVES' reliance on Docker for isolating and deploying components across its distributed infrastructure.
Deploying the Jellyfin AI Media Stack with the Cataclysm Provisioning Bundle
The Cataclysm Provisioning Bundle is specifically designed for the mass deployment of Docker Compose stacks on various workstations and edge devices. This makes it an ideal tool for deploying your Jellyfin AI Media Stack across your PMOVES distributed hardware.
Hereâ€™s how you can achieve this:
â€¢ Docker Compose Integration: The Jellyfin AI Media Stack is already structured as a multi-service Docker application, as indicated by the presence of docker-compose.yml in your Pmoves-Jelly repository. The Cataclysm bundle supports deploying "Ready-to-run Docker Compose stacks". You would integrate the Jellyfin stack's docker-compose.yml and associated configuration files into the Cataclysm bundle.
â€¢ Automated Deployment Scripts:
    â—¦ Ubuntu Autoinstall (Servers/VMs): For Linux-based hosts like your workstations, the Cataclysm bundle uses linux/ubuntu-autoinstall/user-data for unattended Ubuntu installs, which also sets up Docker. This script can be extended to include commands to clone the Pmoves-Jelly repository (or a subset of it), navigate to the Jellyfin AI Media Stack directory, and execute docker compose up -d to bring up the entire stack automatically.
    â—¦ Jetson Orin Nano Bootstrap (Edge Devices): For your Edge Computing Jetson Orin Nano Super devices, the Cataclysm bundle uses jetson/jetson-postinstall.sh to bootstrap Docker and NVIDIA runtime. Given that the Jellyfin stack's AI models (e.g., NVIDIA Sortformer) benefit from GPU acceleration, deploying the Audio AI Service and Video AI Service microservices specifically to these Jetson devices would be highly efficient. A dedicated Docker Compose file or modifications to the jetson-postinstall.sh could selectively deploy these services, integrating them into the larger PMOVES edge computing strategy.
â€¢ Configuration and Secrets Management:
    â—¦ The Jellyfin AI Media Stack relies on environment variables (.env file) for configuration, including Supabase credentials, Neo4j password, and API keys.
    â—¦ The Cataclysm bundle manages secrets through placeholders and scripts. You can create a template .env file within the provisioning bundle with placeholders (e.g., SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL_HERE) that your Cataclysm post-install scripts can populate with actual secrets, potentially sourced from a secure vault or encrypted configuration.
    â—¦ The Supabase setup script required by the Jellyfin stack could also be included in the Cataclysm provisioning process, perhaps by executing it via the Supabase CLI as part of an initial setup script on the host where the database is configured.
By combining the AI capabilities of the Jellyfin stack with the autonomous orchestration of PMOVES and the efficient deployment of Cataclysm, you can create a highly sophisticated, self-managing media intelligence and content creation system.
